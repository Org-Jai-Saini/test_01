    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It consists of elements represented by tags that define the content and layout of the web page.</p>

    <h1>What are HTML tags? Give examples.</h1>
    <p>HTML tags are code snippets enclosed within angle brackets (< >) that define elements on a webpage. Tags typically come in pairs: opening tag <tag> and closing tag </tag>.</p>

    <h1> What is the purpose of the <head> tag in an HTML document?</h1>
    <p>The <head>tag is used to contain meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title, character set, and links to stylesheets or scripts. This information is not displayed directly on the web page but is essential for the browser and search engines.</p>

    <h1>What is the purpose of the <body> tag in an HTML document?</h1>
    <p>The <body> tag is used to contain the main content of the HTML document, including text, images, links, and other media. This content is displayed in the browser window and is what users interact with on the web page.</p>

    <h1>What is the purpose of the <title> tag in an HTML document?</h1>
    <p>The <title> tag is used to define the title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. It is important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and helps users identify the content of the page.</p>
